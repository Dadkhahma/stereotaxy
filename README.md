Motorized Stereotaxic System (MSS)
# Introduction
The main aim of this repository is to share our efforts for motorization of stereotaxic system in the field of neuroscience, so other neuroscientists and researcher in the field can make their way easier, especially when they are at the begining. This system has some adavantages over manual system, which one of them is simplification of the procedure. Also we believe that with increasing the precision and accuracy, the need for more animal will be reduced which is very appreciated.
TheÂ MSS software, is available freely and has been developed for finding coordinates of different brain areas for rat brain surgery, cannula implantation and electrophysiology experiments.
As noted before, this motorized system by increasing accuracy, help you to save time during the surgery and enjoy it. What makes this system such a suitable for researcher is the high potential in calculating each coordinat precisely. So, the researcher will not do more surgeries to validate the relevant areas of brain.
