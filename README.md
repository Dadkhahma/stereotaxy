Motorized Stereotaxic System
# Introduction
The main aim of this repository is to share our efforts for motorization of stereotaxic system in the field of neuroscience, so other neuroscientists and researcher in the field can make their way easier, especially when they are at the begining. This system has some adavantages over manual system, which one of them is simplification of the procedure. Also we believe that with increasing the precision and accuracy, the need for more animal will be reduced which is very appreciated.
